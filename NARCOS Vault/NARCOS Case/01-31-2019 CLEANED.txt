Yo, what you after?
Also, that contact card didn't open, and I can't be bothered with new clients—got bigger fish to fry right now...
Aight cool, umm actually I have a proposition for ya
I have a business dealing happening overseas and need you to accompany me as cover. Everything will be paid for, but you need to keep quiet.
Yea, I understand, but I’ll make it worth your while
I didn’t want to do this, but you leave me no choice
You don’t wanna see them hurt, do ya?
Good, now that’s what I wanted to hear. Here is the plan:
You will act like a couple traveling to New Zealand on holiday. Look the part, act normal, and don’t tell anyone about what we’re doing. Understood?
Good talk, tomorrow at 3PM, or else
